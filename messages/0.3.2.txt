Python Breakpoints 0.3.2 Changelog:

Please be sure to restart Sublime Text to start using the new version.


New features:

 - The plugin has been simplified to address some cases when it wouldn't work
   with Python 2 constructs failing under ST3 syntax tree interpreter.

 - Insertion of the import statement has been removed. All breakpoints are now
   one-liners in the following format:

   import {debugger}; {debugger}.set_trace()  # breakpoint {uid} // user-comment

 - You can now add your text to the breakpoint (note the "user-comment" above).
   It'll be displayed nicely in the "Goto Breakpoint" menu and help navigation.
   Make sure to keep all your text in the same line.

 - Added a customizable gutter icon (feature request by @j9ac9k), on by default.


Compatibility warnings:

 - Breakpoints created and saved by the earlier versions of the plugin will not
   be recognized, you'll have to re-insert them and manually delete the import
   statement. Sorry..

 - One-liner format of the breakpoint isn't PEP8 compliant (compound statement),
   so your linter may produce warnings.
