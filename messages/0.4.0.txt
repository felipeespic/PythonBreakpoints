Python Breakpoints 0.4.0 Changelog:


New features:

 - Now if you select a block of code (one or multiple lines), and press Toggle Breakpoint,
   the selected lines will be wrapped in a try-except statement and a new breakpoint will
   be added under the except: section.

   To undo this construct simply place the cursor on the breakpoint and press Toggle, as
   you would for a regular breakpoint.
